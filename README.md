## Archived Readme from the fork of `sidehustlelab/account-switcher`

#### Download and install from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-app-account-switch/gkdjdghoaaooagapfhmjgnagiigocjob/related?) | [Firefox Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/account-switcher-google-apps/)

### What does the extension do ?
This extension is for people using multiple Google accounts in their browser.
It often becomes a hassle switching between the different accounts for various Google apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Play Music, Google Drive etc.
This extension gives you the ability to switch across accounts seamlessly using keyboard shortcuts in Chrome.

So google gives logged in accounts numbers: 0, 1, 2...

So the extension makes use of that numbering.

To switch to say account number 2, you have to press `Alt + 2` once you have already opened any of the supported google apps mentioned above.

Say you have gmail account 0 open, you can press `Alt+2` to open the gmail account associated with account 2.
